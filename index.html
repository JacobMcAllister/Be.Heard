                                    Be Heard is an application designed to assist in the rehabilitation and development of successful speech patterns for those who struggle due to injury or from otherwise similar speech defects.  Be Heard will utilize effective methods as proposed by speech pathologists to strengthen the speech patterns of the user and then work within those methods using a sophisticated machine learning algorithm to focus and improve on the areas of speech that the user needs the most help with.  Over time, the users of Be Heard will be more successful in their everyday conversation and can communicate with their community more effectively.<br /><br />Along with its machine learning aspects this project hopes to showcase the Be Heard team-member's ability to learn and implement full stack web development tools and technologies start to finish.  Some of the technologies used by the Be Heard team are .NET, SQL, CSharp, Bootstrap 5.0, JSON, and more.

                                    Description: The text discusses using Python for natural language Processing. Natural language processing that involves identifying nouns, verbs etc. The text also covers how to build proper sentences. This text will be exceptionally useful for building the sentences that are delivered to patients. The text specifically is meant for learning how to process natural language and build sentences with software.
